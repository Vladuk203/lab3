<h3 id="chicken">Chicken</h3>
    <p>Most chicken breast recipes call for cooking the chicken to 160 degrees F, 
  which is the desired final temperature, but if you pull the chicken breasts from the oven at 155 degrees F, 
     they will continue cooking and the temperature will rise at least another 5 degrees to 160 degrees F (known as carry-over cooking).  
   If you wait to pull the chicken from the over until it reaches 160 degrees F, the chicken breasts will be slightly overcooked.<br>

      <h3 id="beef">Beef</h3>
  <p>Drizzle the beef with oil and season well with sea salt and black pepper, 
 then rub all over the meat. Place the beef on top of the vegetables. 
    Place the tray in the oven, then turn the heat down immediately to 200°C/400°F/gas 6 
    And cook for 1 hour for medium beef. If you’re doing roast potatoes and veggies 
    this is the time to crack on with them – get them into the oven for the last 45 minutes of cooking.<br>

       <h3 id="sushi">Sushi</h3>
  <p>Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear, 
     then soak roughly two parts rice to three parts cold water in a saucepan for 30 minutes.
     Next, bring the rice to the boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the rice has absorbed all the water and is tender. 
     Hold the near edge of the mat, lift and roll away from you, encasing the filling. Ensure the ingredients stay in place and the rice sticks.
        Check the packet instructions for exact timings.<br>    </p>
